This is a planet simulation made with python, and the library pygame. Now the goal of this going to be to simulate the orbits of different planets around the sun. Real astronomical values is being used, so the real mass of the sun, the real distance from earth to the sun, all that type of stuffs; I applied the force of gravity between all the planets, so we actually get an accurate elliptical orbit.

I'm not simulating every single planet. However, I'm simulating the dour closest to the sun. So we have earth, mars, venus, and mercury. I'm doing that to get a nice visual and I can see everything nice and large.

If I were to simulate planets that are much further away from the sun, then you're going to see all these planets kinda smushed really closed to the sun, and then the huge orbit around the sun from the larger planets.
